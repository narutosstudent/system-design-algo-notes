# API Design

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules that allows one software application to talk to another software application. It's a way to allow software applications to communicate with each other.

## Why do we need APIs?

APIs are important because they allow different software applications to communicate with each other. This means that different software applications can work together, and share data with each other.

## Why APIs are important for companies

You can imagine a company like Stripe, which provides a payment processing service. Stripe has an API that allows other software applications to communicate with it. This means that other software applications can use Stripe's payment processing service, and they don't have to build their own payment processing service from scratch.

This makes API a core part of the modern software ecosystem. It allows companies to build on top of each other's services, and it allows software applications to work together.

## Types of APIs

There are different types of APIs, such as:

- RESTful APIs: These are APIs that follow the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
- SOAP APIs: These are APIs that use the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to send and receive messages.
- GraphQL APIs: These are APIs that use the GraphQL query language to send and receive messages.
- RPC APIs: These are APIs that use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to send and receive messages.
- WebSockets: These are APIs that allow for full-duplex communication between the client and the server.

## Changes to an API

If your customers are using your API, then you have to be careful about making changes to it. If you make a breaking change to your API, then your customers will have to update their software applications to work with the new version of your API.

When you make changes to your API, you have to think about how it will affect your customers. You have to think about how it will affect their software applications, and how it will affect their users.

When making changes, typically you would version your API. This means that you would have different versions of your API, and your customers can choose which version they want to use.

This allows you to make changes to your API, without breaking your customers' software applications.

## Swagger

Swagger is a tool that allows you to document your API. It allows you to describe your API, and it allows you to generate client libraries for your API. This makes it easier for your customers to use your API. It also makes it easier for you to make changes to your API, because you can see how your API is being used. This allows you to make changes to your API without breaking your customers' software applications.

OpenAPI is the new name for Swagger. It's a specification for describing RESTful APIs. It allows you to describe your API, and it allows you to generate client libraries for your API.
