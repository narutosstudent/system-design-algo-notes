# Communication in system design interviews

Communication is key in system design interviews. You need to communicate with the interviewer to gather the requirements and constraints of the system. You need to communicate your plan to the interviewer before you start designing the system. You need to communicate your thoughts as you're designing the system. You need to communicate your trade-offs. You need to communicate your assumptions. You need to communicate your reasoning.

A bad question is a vague one, e.g. how big is the system we're designing?

A better question is a specific one, e.g. how many users are we expecting to have and where are they located?
