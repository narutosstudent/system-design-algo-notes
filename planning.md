# Planning in system design interviews

When asked e.g. to design Youtube, you want to start off by asking questions to gather the requirements and constraints of the system.

Then before you even dive into designing the actual system, you want to write a high level plan of what you're going to do. This is important because it shows the interviewer that you have a plan and that you're not just going to start coding without thinking.

It also helps you to organize your thoughts and to make sure that you're not missing anything.

It's also easier for the interviewer to follow along with your thought process if you have a plan. And if you're wrong somewhere, the interviewer can correct you before you've spent a lot of time designing the system.
