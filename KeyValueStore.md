# Key Value Store

Relational Databases have strict structures and schemas, they can be good, but sometimes we need more flexibility. Key-Value Stores are a type of NoSQL database that allows you to store data without a strict schema. This means you can store any type of data in any format, and you can change the format at any time. This flexibility makes Key-Value Stores a good choice for certain types of data, such as user preferences, session data, and other unstructured data.

Key Value stores are one of the most popular types of NoSQL databases. They are used by many large companies, such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google, to store and manage large amounts of data.

One of the use cases is caching, where you can store the results of expensive operations in a Key-Value Store, so you donâ€™t have to perform the operation again.

Feature flagging is another use case, where you can store feature flags in a Key-Value Store, so you can turn features on and off without having to redeploy your application.
