# Configuration

When working in a distributed systems environment, you will often need to configure your system. This is because distributed systems are often complex and require a lot of configuration. This is because distributed systems often have many moving parts. For example, you might have a database, a cache, a load balancer, and a web server. Each of these parts will need to be configured. This is because each part will need to know how to talk to the other parts. For example, the web server will need to know how to talk to the database. The database will need to know how to talk to the cache. The cache will need to know how to talk to the load balancer. The load balancer will need to know how to talk to the web server. This is why configuration is important.

Configuration files are often written in a format that is easy to read and write. For example, you might write your configuration files in JSON, YAML, or TOML. These formats are easy to read and write. This is because they are human readable. This is important because you will often need to read and write configuration files. This is because you will often need to change your configuration files. This is because you will often need to change your configuration. For example, you might need to change your database password. You might need to change your cache size. You might need to change your load balancer algorithm. This is why configuration files are often written in a format that is easy to read and write.

## Static configuration

Static configuration is when your configuration is hard coded into your system. Changes here are slow because you have to recompile and redeploy.

## Dynamic configuration

Dynamic configuration lives outside of your system, and can be changed without recompiling and redeploying your system.
