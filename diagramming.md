# Diagramming

Diagramming is an important thing in system design interviews.

It helps both the interviewer and the interviewee to understand the flow of the system and the components involved.

If you take notes, do the them at the side, to not clutter the diagram.

Try to use different shapes and colors. This helps to differentiate between different components.
